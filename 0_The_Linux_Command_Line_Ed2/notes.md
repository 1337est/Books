# Part I: Learning the Shell

## Chapter 1: What is the Shell?

The command line refers to the shell. The shell is a program that uses keyboard commands to pass instructions to the OS. Almost all Linux distros have a shell called "bash".

### **Terminal Emulators**
When using a GUI, you likely need a terminal emulator.
KDE uses konsole
GNOME uses gnome-terminal

### **The Shell**
Shell prompts have $, and `username@machine directory`.
When "$" is replaced by "#", it means root privileges (super user).

### **Commands**
- `date` - displays current date & time.
- `cal` - a calendar for the current month.
- `df` - Shows the disk space that's free on your hard drives.
    - I'll be using duf on Arch, as it's a cleaner/nicer looking df.
- `free` - Shows the free RAM space in your machine.
- `exit` - self explanatory

### **The Console Behind the Curtain**
Pressing CTRL-ALT-(F1 through F6) will access different login sessions, prompting you to login with your username and password.
